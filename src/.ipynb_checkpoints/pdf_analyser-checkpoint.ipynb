      "Question: What is generative AI?\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence technologies, specifically focused on the generation of new content based on data input. It's often used in natural language processing tasks such as text completion and augmentation where it can produce diverse types of content like articles or social media posts tailored for specific purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe human guide to generative ai\n",
      "Answer: In this eGuide, we aim to provide a comprehensive yet easily understandable overview of the technologies surrounding generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). We'll start by defining what generative AI technology is and diving into its origins. Moving forward, it’s crucial for users to know how this powerful tool functions - explaining the workings of machine learning in layman terms makes understanding possible even without technical expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won't stop at just exploring what generative AI can do; we will also tackle its limitations and discuss when not to rely on it, as no technology is perfect or foolproof. This holistic view provides users a balanced perspective of the implications this powerful tool might have for various industries, from business to education sectors - sparking an awareness that leads towards more informed decisions about generative AI integration in daily operations and future planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "A panel discussion is scheduled titled \"Changing the Pace of Manufacturing Transformation through Generative AI\". This session will delve deeper into how companies can reshape their operational landscapes using innovations like ChatGPT that represent significant turning points for industries worldwide, potentially redefining manufacturing transformation and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the guide introduces 'ATCx' – AI for Engineers - aimed at democratizing access to generative AI within this specific field of work by promoting quicker adoption without necessitating a deep understanding of coding or underlying algorithms. This makes it easier for engineers and other non-technical professionals in the industry to leverage these advancements effectively, boosting productivity while fostering innovation across various facets within their sectors – from design to manufacturing itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Does this support RAG\n",
      "Answer: Yes. The Altair RapidMiner extension supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which is a process that limits the model's frame of reference to real and vetted information, thereby enhancing result accuracy while reducing hallucinations or AI generating inaccurate results based on misinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Are their pre trained models\n",
      "Answer: Yes, there are numerous open source language model (LLM) that the Altair RapidMiner extension has access to on Hugging Face. Additionally, it also provides public versions of some of the largest market models like ChatGPT for use in various tasks without requiring users to code anything themselves as explained towards the end of Document 0 and beginning of Documents 1-3 above which describe these functionalities more deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Can we trust RAG results\n",
      "Answer: In the context provided, RapidMiner's Altair extension utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. This below-the-surface process helps limit a model’s frame of reference to real and vetted information which increases query result accuracy while reducing AI hallucination likelihood. Hence, one can trust the RAG results as they are more accurate with fewer hallucinations due to this system in place within Altair RapidMiner extension's generative AI tool framework.\n",
