Hi guys, today we are going to look at a leadcode problem contains duplicate. In this problem we have an integer array numbs and we need to find whether that integer array contains any duplicate value or not. If it contains any duplicate value we need to return true, else we need to return false. To solve this problem we are going to use a set of integer. Set basically have a property to contain only non distinct value and the search time of a set is big of one. So it will give the constant search time. So let us iterate over this integer array and here we are going to check if set contains this value n then we will return false. Otherwise we will simply add the element into the set. It does not contain any return value so from here we will return false. So here we need to return true if it contains a duplicate then we are returning true if not then we are returning false. Let us try to run. Submit.
